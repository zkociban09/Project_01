# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
I want to make a 2d retro style game for my project. I would love to make something besides a side scroller,
but I think that a side scroller is way more of a realistic option, but I am not sure yet. I want there to be
combat in the game, but not a lot. I am not sure if I would be able to develop a combat system, so I would make certain
parts involve certain challenges that simulate combat. For example I want the goal of the game to be to collect 5 pieces
of a sword and then once you have the 5 pieces you are able to defeat the final boss. The combat would be that the 
final boss keeps flying away from you and is a set distance away at all times while shooting projectiles so it is impossibel to slash the sword
instead to defeat the boss you would throw the sword at them. To get the sword pieces there may be other little combat
scenarios or puzzles to solve. I would possibly like to put little hints lying around, for example a scroll that hints 
that the only way to defeat the final boss is to throw the sword at it. I would possibly like to make some sort of character 
customization, a custom name at the very least. I would like to hopefully make the art assets via some sort of pixel art
I am not really sure how that would work. I would also like to input music of some kind as well. This is a stretch but 
also possibly an inventory system as well.

## Do you have any questions of your own?
Does my preposal seem realistic in the timeframe we are given, I have not much programming experience outside of this class.
